<p>
 Consider the following configuration of 64 triangles:
</p>
<div class="center">
 <img alt="" class="dark_img" src="project/images/p189_grid.gif"/>
</div>
<p>
 We wish to colour the interior of each triangle with one of three colours: red, green or blue, so that no two neighbouring triangles have the same colour. Such a colouring shall be called valid. Here, two triangles are said to be neighbouring if they share an edge.
 <br/>
 Note: if they only share a vertex, then they are not neighbours.
</p>
<p>
 For example, here is a valid colouring of the above grid:
</p>
<div class="center">
 <img alt="" class="dark_img" src="project/images/p189_colours.gif"/>
</div>
<p>
 A colouring C' which is obtained from a colouring C by rotation or reflection is considered
 <i>
  distinct
 </i>
 from C unless the two are identical.
</p>
<p>
 How many distinct valid colourings are there for the above configuration?
</p>
