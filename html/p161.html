</p>
<p>
 Any n by m grid for which nxm is divisible by 3 can be tiled with triominoes.
 <br/>
 If we consider tilings that can be obtained by reflection or rotation from another tiling as different there are 41 ways a 2 by 9 grid can be  tiled with triominoes:
</p>
<p class="center">
 <img alt="" class="dark_img" src="project/images/p161_k9.gif"/>
</p>
<p>
 In how many ways can a 9 by 12 grid be tiled in this way by triominoes?
