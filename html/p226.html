<p>
 The
 <i>
  blancmange curve
 </i>
 is the set of points $(x, y)$ such that $0 \le x \le 1$ and $y = \sum \limits_{n = 0}^{\infty} {\dfrac{s(2^n x)}{2^n}}$, where $s(x)$ is the distance from $x$ to the nearest integer.
</p>
<p>
 The area under the blancmange curve is equal to ½, shown in pink in the diagram below.
